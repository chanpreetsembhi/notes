Written by John Keats, a poet of the Romantic bastion of the 19th century who was known for his 'ode' and 'negative capability' technique. In Ode To Autumn, the first stanza discusses the abundance and ripeness that autumn brings. The poem opens by presenting autumn as a season of "mellow fruitfulness". It is depicted as a close friend of the sun, working together to ripen fruits (such as vines, apples, and gourds) to the core and filling hazel shells. The warmth causes late flowers to bloom, tricking bees into believing summer will never end. 

The second stanza personifies autumn. Autumn is shown as a female figure often seen lounging, resting on a granary floor with hair lifted by the breeze, sleeping on a half-reaped furrow, or watching a cider press with "patient look". She is portrayed as a calm, content worker, embodying the harvest's slow, steady pace. 

The third stanza uses auditory/sonic expression. The stanza shifts from visual imagery to the sounds of autumn, signalling the transition to winter. The speaker tells Autumn to ignore the songs of spring and instead appreciate her own music: the humming of gnats, bleating of lambs, singing of crickets, and the whistling of robins (referred to as the 'red-breasted). The poem ends with swallows(a type of bird) gathering, preparing for migration as the "soft-dying day" turns to night.
The key themes explored in Ode To Autumn are the peak of nature's productivity through its abundance and maturity. The next key theme in the poem is the definitive inevitability of coming winter through the transition and decay. The finalizing theme of Ode To Autumn is acceptance and welcoming the fleeting beauty of the present moment.

Overall, Ode To Autumn is a profound piece of work in Romantic literature and is considered one of the most influential artworks when it comes to poetry in English literature.
