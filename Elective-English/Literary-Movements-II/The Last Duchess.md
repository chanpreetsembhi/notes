Written by Robert Browning, a poet of the Victorian era and known for his delivery style of Dramatic Monologues, The Last Duchess is a sinister poem that subtly hints at a character described as the Duke of Ferrara’s implied murder of his wife, the “Duchess”. Throughout the poem, it is explored how his jealousy, controlling nature, pride, and vanity may have led him to conspire to have the Duchess murdered, following which, he has a portrait made for her to hide his heinousness from the world. 

In the poem, the Duke shows the envoy a portrait of his late wife, painted by a man named Fra Pandolf, praising its life-like quality. Throughout the poem, he reveals his grievances towards her from the time when she was alive. He laments over her perpetual blushing, innocence and smiles and equates all of it with “foolishness”. This part of the poem unveils his deviousness in how he resented the independence of an innocent woman and wanted to keep her dominated. The lines “I gave commands. Then all smiles stopped altogether.”  hint at the possible conspiracy of the Duke having secretly gotten the Duchess silenced forever. 

The closing lines “Notice Neptune, though,/ Taming a sea-horse,” signal his intent to dominate his next duchess. The poem is a chilling representation of how jealousy drove the Duke to view his wife as an object of possession, rather than a fellow human being. Her independent demeanour disgusted his fragile ego, which could have possibly led to his implied heinous crime. The poem exposes the Renaissance aristocracy and its patriarchal control over women through the Duke’s earnest monologue.
