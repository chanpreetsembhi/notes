Realism emerged as a major artistic and literary movement in mid-19th-century Europe, primarily as a direct counterpart to Romanticism’s emotional excess and idealization. It began around the 1840s in France, led by artists like Gustave Courbet amid social upheavals from the Industrial Revolution and political shifts. Rejecting all things Romantic, Realism sought truthful depictions of everyday life, ordinary people, and contemporary social issues without accentuations or embellishments.

The core characteristics of Realism focused on working-class subjects, urban/rural scenes, unglamorous and complex reality, accurately detailed representations, social commentary on poverty, labour, and inequality, and treating all classes equally. Influencing literature, democratising art, and paving the way for Impressionism by prioritizing observation over imagination, Realism helped portray unidealized humans in real settings.
