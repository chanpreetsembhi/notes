Written by Thomas Hardy, a novelist and poet of the Realist era of English literature, The Man He Killed is a short dramatic monologue that explores the tragic irony of war using a soldier’s reflection on shooting a foe dead who, in other circumstances, could have been a potential friend. The poet hypothesizes that if he and "the man he killed" had met at some olden tavern or pub, they would have gotten drunk together like some good old friends rather than foes. However, Hardy laments that because of the manufactured animosity planted by their respective political sides, he is compelled to treat "the man" as his enemy and forced to shoot him dead. 

The short poem is a haunting meditation that shows the shared humanity lost in the guise of a battlefield encounter. This solidifies his stance on the horrors of war and his contemplation of humanizing those whom we are supposed to treat as enemies. The poem can also be seen as a political commentary critiquing the self-centred tendencies of political powers that turn masses against one another. The poem not only explores the absurdity and senselessness of war but also explores moral ambiguity as the speaker struggles to justify the act beyond his call of duty.
