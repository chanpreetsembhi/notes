Romanticism was a transformative artistic, literary Nd intellectual movement that emerged in Europe in the late 18th century and became the zeitgeist in the early 19th century. Romanticism arose as a form of reactionary movement to contrast the rationalism of the Enlightenment period of art and the uniformity of the Industrial Revolution. Thinkers and artists went against the grain by putting forward the very emotions, individuality and imaginative thought they had been neglecting in lieu of strict rules and logic.

The core themes in Romantic art and literature that were explored were the reverence for nature as a source of inspiration and spiritual truth, the celebration of sublime feelings of awe, terror, agony, wonder etc., and the focus on the heroic individual, folklore and/or the supernatural and exotic. Romanticism shaped poetry though people like William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge, art through people like Caspar Friedrich and music through legendary artists like Beethoven and emphasized authentic self-expression along with influencing modern ideas of creativity and personal freedom.
