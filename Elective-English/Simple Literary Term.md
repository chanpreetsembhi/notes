#### Prose
The word 'prose' comes from the Latin word 'proza', which means plain or straightforward speech. Prose is a simple and direct way of using language, whether spoken or written. Unlike poetry, it doesn’t follow special rules for rhythm or rhyme. Prose is used in things like essays, short stories, and novels. Some well-known writers of prose include Sir Walter Raleigh, Sir Francis Bacon, and Sir Thomas Browne.

#### Essay
An essay is a piece of writing on a specific topic. Its purpose can be to entertain, give information, or share an opinion. There are two main types of essays: formal and informal. Formal essays are serious, well-organized, and often longer. Informal essays are more personal, showing the writer’s thoughts, feelings, or humor. For example, "Bores" by E.V. Lucas is an informal essay. Francis Bacon is known for his formal essays like "Of Truth," "Of Studies," and "Of Adversity."

#### Drama
Drama is a type of story written in the form of dialogues and acted out on stage. Actors play the roles of the characters and perform the actions written in the script. It is different from a novel because, in drama, the story is shown by actors instead of being told in words. Examples of drama are _King Lear_ and _Othello_ by Shakespeare.

#### Comedy 
Comedy is a type of drama that has a happy ending. It is meant to make people laugh and enjoy. Comedies are written to entertain and amuse the audience. _As You Like It_ and _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ are famous comedies by William Shakespeare. _Every Man in His Humour_ by Ben Jonson is another well-known comedy, called a "comedy of humour."

#### Tragedy
Tragedy is a type of drama that has a sad ending. In a tragedy, the story ends with the hero’s suffering, downfall, or even death. The tragic hero is usually an important person like a king or prince. His pain makes the audience feel pity and fear. He suffers more than he deserves because of his mistakes. _Macbeth_ and _King Lear_ by Shakespeare are famous tragedies.

#### Tragi-comedy
A tragi-comedy is a mix of tragedy and comedy. It has a serious story and theme, and at first, it looks like the ending will be sad. But in the end, something happens that changes everything, and the story ends happily. _The Merchant of Venice_ by Shakespeare is a good example of a tragi-comedy.

#### Mock-Epic
A **Mock-Epic** is a funny poem or story that treats a silly or ordinary subject like a grand, heroic tale. It uses serious language and epic style to describe small events. This makes the story sound overly dramatic and creates humor by showing how people can exaggerate simple things. _“The Rape of the Lock”_ was written by **Alexander Pope**, and _“Mac Flecknoe”_ was written by **John Dryden** — both are famous examples of mock-epic poetry.

A **mock-epic** is a funny poem or story that talks about something small or silly as if it is very serious and important. It uses grand words and a heroic style to describe simple things, which makes it sound funny. This kind of writing shows how people can make small things seem too big. _The Rape of the Lock_ by **Alexander Pope** and _Mac Flecknoe_ by **John Dryden** are well-known mock-epic poems.

#### Setting
Setting is the time and place where a story happens. It tells us when the story takes place (like in the past, present, or future) and where it happens (like in a city, village, or fantasy world). A good setting helps readers imagine the story better. For example, in the book _Oliver Twist_ by **Charles Dickens**, the setting is the poor and dirty streets of old London. Another example is _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone_ by **J.K. Rowling**, where the setting is a magical school called Hogwarts.

#### Short story
A **short story** is a brief work of fiction that focuses on a single event, character, or theme, often leaving a strong impression or moral for the reader. Writers like **Edgar Allan Poe**, known for his dark and suspenseful tales like _The Tell-Tale Heart_, and **O. Henry**, famous for his surprise endings in stories like _The Gift of the Magi_, showcase the power of short stories to evoke emotion and deliver meaningful messages in a compact form.
