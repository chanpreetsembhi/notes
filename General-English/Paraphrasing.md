##### Q. What is paraphrasing?
**Ans.** Paraphrasing means restating the sense of the passage in words that are easier to understand. In paraphrasing the reader must see to it that meaning, tone and feeling of the original piece remains intact. The reader is not suppose to give his own idea in a para. There is no limit to the size of the para. If the thought content of the passage is very complex, It has to be clarified in it para. Thus a para may be as long as the passage itself. but normally, the para should not be too long. It should be about 60% of the length of the text.
